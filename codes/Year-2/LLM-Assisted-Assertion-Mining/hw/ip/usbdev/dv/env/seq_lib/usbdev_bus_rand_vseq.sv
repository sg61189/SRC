// disconnections)  during a streaming test. Note that when such a stimulus is produced we do not
// really expect the current traffic to be unaffected, since the DUT would normally be reconfigured
// by the USB host upon reconnection.
//
// Rather, the aim is to test the DUT does not get stuck in an irrecoverable state preventing
// communications from being re-established. The host- and device-side code in
// `usbdev_max_usb_traffic_vseq` is thus notified of Bus Resets event, so that it can adapt its
// internal state according to the expect DUT changes. (eg. zeroing of device address and resetting
// of data toggles.)
